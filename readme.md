# Everything NFT

Welcome to the NFT Contracts repository! This repository aims to cover various aspects and general real-life use cases of NFT contracts using the ERC721 standard from OpenZeppelin.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of NFT contract implementations and their applications. It provides a valuable resource for developers, enthusiasts, and anyone interested in learning about and exploring the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).We will go all the way from minting to signature based whitelist creation step by step.

Any queries are Welcome ! Hope this repo changes your perspective of NFT-Contracts

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **Contracts:** Contains the Solidity code for different NFT contracts built on the ERC721 standard. Each contract has its own directory, providing a clear organization for easy navigation and understanding.

- **Examples:** Offers practical examples and demonstrations of how to utilize the NFT contracts in real-world scenarios. These examples provide insights into the potential applications of NFTs beyond just collectibles.

- **Contributing:** Welcomes contributions from the community. If you have any improvements, new use cases, or additional contracts to suggest, please refer to the contributing guidelines.
